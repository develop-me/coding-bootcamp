#Helping you to Succeed

We really welcome your feedback and we request you do the same. If you don't take on board feedback and improve then you may not be able to progress to the final 4 weeks.

It is so important that you keeping up so you are in a good position at the end of the course to get one of the opportunities we organise. So please 
be prepared to allow our mentoring and feedback sessions to be a two way street.
