#Friday 1:1 Sessions

It is important to feel you can feedback or voice any concerns as you move through the Bootcamp and we will always give you pointers on how to 
make the most of your time with us.
So each Friday you will have a session with Oli or Pete so that everyone is kept in the loop with how your skills and developing and how are you 
feeling and settling in.
The sessions will evolve towards guidance on preparing for interviews as the Bootcamp progresses so a lot of the advice will be practical too. 
Please do let us know anything that might be playing on your mind or holding you back.
