#Develop the right mindset 

Don't worry about others who seem better/faster than you and never think a question is silly. 

Really make an effort to be positive and have an 'I can' attitude. Only look forwards and not sideways at others during your time in Bootcamp. Some will find some areas easy and other tricky, so it is not possible to compare. 

Ask for help, you're not expected to know everything, and you're not in this alone. We're here to help. 9 times out of 10 you ask a question, others will be glad you did as they wanted to know the answer too but were not brave enough to ask - be that brave one.

Don't let problems get you down, they are a chance to learn something. Read, experiment, take a walk, have a good nights sleep and just start each day fresh and with an 'I can' attitude.

Just accept that you won't know it all, there is complexity behind the scenes that you don't need to know, and may never know.
