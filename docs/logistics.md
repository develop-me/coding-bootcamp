#Parking

We find that many students who live locally cycle and we have bike racks outside our training space. This accomodates motorbikes too. 
For those of you driving there is often free all day parking on the Bath Road just the main Paintworks entrance. If you do not find a spot there, try the residential road
off on the left as you drive closer to town as this often has spaces. If you still struggle then head to the 3 hours free visitors car park onsite then nip out and find a space at lunch time.

#Coming by train - Temple Meads is out local train station and the walk from there to our unit is around 20 minutes.

#Refreshments

We provide tea and coffee, fresh fruit and biscuits to keep your energy and attention nice and high at all times! For your meals we have a small kitchen with microwave and fridges
which you are welcome to use. There is a lovely eatery just next door called the BocaBar and they do a great variety of food and also a snack van which does ligther bites. If you need to pop to the shops, then there is a supermarket within
5 - 6 minutes walk.

#Access

We provide you with a key/code so if you arrive early or want to stay in the training space late then you have the freedom to do this.
