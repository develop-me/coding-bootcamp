# The Coffee Machine

## Turning It On

The on/off button is the round button on the top left of the machine

## Americano

If you want to make an Americano you're probably best choosing the Espresso button and then topping it up with hot water from the kettle.

## Common Issues

- If the machine has run out of water, the middle warning indicator will flash: there's a measuring jug and a funnel that you can use to top it back up. Pour it in to the reservoir at the back.

- If the machine has run out of coffee beans, it'll make some horrible noises and the exclamation warning sign will start flashing.
