# Develop the right mindset

Don't worry about others who seem better/faster than you and never think a question is silly.

Really make an effort to be positive and have an 'I can' attitude. Only look forwards and not sideways at others during your time in Bootcamp. Some will find some areas easy and other tricky, so it is not possible to compare.

Ask for help, you're not expected to know everything, and you're not in this alone. We're here to help. 9 times out of 10 you ask a question, others will be glad you did as they wanted to know the answer too but were not brave enough to ask - be that brave one.

Don't let problems get you down, they are a chance to learn something. Read, experiment, take a walk, have a good nights sleep and just start each day fresh and with an 'I can' attitude.

Just accept that you won't know it all, there is complexity behind the scenes that you don't need to know, and may never know.

# Understanding Talent

Have a read of these lists to help you identify where you sit on the spectrum of being 'teachable and open' to developing your talent.

SET TALENT - you believe you either have talent or not

You avoid challenges in case you fail and makes you feel untalented
You give up easily so why bother as it means I am not talented if I have to keep trying
You see putting in effort as bad as it makes you think you might not be talented if you have to try hard
You do not like taking feedback as it makes you feel like you are not talented to be critiqued
You feel threatened by other people being successful as it makes you question if you are talented enough to do the same

With a Set Talent mindset you will not move forward and your knowledge will plateau and you might even quit

TALENT IS GROWN - you understand that talent can be acheived through growth

You seek challenges as if you fail you know that will teach you something
You keep trying and you know if you will learn something if you over come it
You see effort as key because the harder you work the better you get
You ask for feedback as you know you can learn from that persons opinion
You feel inspired by others successes as you think 'they are awesome and if they can do it so can I'

With a Talent is Grown mindset you will just keep getting better and better
