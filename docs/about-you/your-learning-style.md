# How do you learn best?

- Are you Visual
Make diagrams to help you remember

- Notes
Keep as you go, remember to listen to the instructor and if the instructor has notes for you, then just concentrate on listening to them talk

- Lists

# Making Mistakes

We learn most from our failures so do not be scared to try things out, even if you're not sure if it will work
Make mini-experiments to test your understanding and remember you can always undo (Ctrl+Z or âŒ˜+Z)!
Copy-and-paste code from Stackoverflow, you'll learn what is relevant/good and what's not

# Feeling out of control - do not worry about uncertainity

You are not expected to understand everything so embrace feeling overwhelmed  and remember you need to go through that stage many times to learn it all.

We give you tools and understanding to be able to know where to delve deeper yourselves in the areas you need too - very much like a University will operates.
