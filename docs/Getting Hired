#Your Career and Beyond

Our goal is to work with you to get a Junior Developer job with one of our employment partners. We have over 35 employment partners and are constantly increasing this.

Often we have partners who are waiting for our cohort to finish so they can interview the graduates. However, we can't guarantee you'll be offered a job and for some it will take longer than others. However, so far 91% of our graduates have got a job with one of our partners with 98% are now working in tech.

Alonside our 1:1 mentoring sessions and a learning attitude, you have a fantastic chance of spring boarding directly into a Tech career and Pete is on hand to help with interview and CV preparation.

If you do not have a job straight from Bootcamp we continue to support you and will keep your knowledge current with a series of ongoing challenges and work designed to keep your expertise nicely honed until you are in a position.
