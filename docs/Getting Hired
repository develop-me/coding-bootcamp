#Your Career and Beyond

Our goal is to work with you to get a Junior Developer job with one of our employment partners. We have over 35 employment partners and are constantly increasing this.

Often we have partners who are waiting for our cohort to finish so they can interview the graduates. However, we can't guarantee you'll be offered a job and for some it will take longer than others. However, so far 91% of our graduates have got a job with one of our partners with 98% are now working in tech.

So alongside our 1:1 mentoring sessions and a learning attitude, you have a fantastic chance of spring boarding directly into a Tech career. 

#Interview Support

Pete is on hand to help with:

Interview preparation and practice
Linking you to jobs to apply for
Reviewing your CV and portfolio projects

#The Process
We match you with 4 companies and we send them over your CVs and technical tests. These will be assessed and you will be invited to interview if the employer happy with the test.
We prepare you for the interview and it is then up to you to attend on time, prepared and ready to show your best side to the employer and also assess the company for if you feel you would like to work there.
Job offers will start to come in or we continue to support you through over applications both organised by us and those you might set up yourself.

#After Bootcamp Ends

If you do not have a job straight from Bootcamp we continue to support you and will keep your knowledge current with a series of ongoing challenges and work designed to keep your expertise nicely honed until you are in a position.

We have an alumni channel on Slack where past graduates post jobs that crop up in the companies they work at. We post about socials in this channel and any reading or meetups that look interesting.
