# Browsers

Most modern browsers come with a good set of developer tools. We'd generally recommend using either Firefox or Chrome. While not identical, they offer very similar functionality.

Chrome tends to be a bit further ahead in terms of cutting-edge technologies, but Firefox is better from a privacy/tracking perspective.

Both browsers have a standard version and a "developer" version. The developer version tends to have newer technologies but may also contain a few bugs.

**We'd recommend using a different browser for everyday browsing and development**: you will probably need to wipe your cache quite regularly, which will lose all of your cookies (login data) for websites that you visit. On a Mac I'd recommend Safari for everyday browsing and Firefox for development. If you love Chrome/Firefox for everyday browsing then you can use the developer version for development, as this has its own cache.
