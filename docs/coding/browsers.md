# Browsers

Most modern browsers come with a good set of developer tools. We'd generally recommend using either Firefox or Chrome. While not identical, they offer very similar functionality.

Chrome tends to be a bit further ahead in terms of cutting-edge technologies, but Firefox is better from a privacy/tracking perspective.

Both browsers have a standard version and a "developer" version. The developer version tends to have newer technologies but may also contain a few bugs.
