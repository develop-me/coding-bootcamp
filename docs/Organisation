#Note Taking

-Should you handwrite or type- Think about which is quicker and do not worry about fancy formatting, just get the information down.
-Digital notes are searchable - a massive bonus.
-Organise by technologies and/or weeks?
-Think about when you start your job, do you have the info you need to do what you are learning currently for yourself?
-Think about how to get setup, what steps to take? Need to turn on or run any software first?
