#Parking

We find that many students who live locally cycle and we have bike racks outside our training spaces - also idea of motorbikes if necessary. 
For those of you that are driving there is often free all day parking on the Bath round just opposite the training space, and if not then try the road
further into town off on the left which is residential and you can often find a space there. If not then you can get a 3 hours free slot in the visitors
parking, then nip out and find a space at lunch time.
Temple Meads is out local train station and the walk from there to our unit is around 20 minutes.

#Refreshments

We provide tea and coffee, fresh fruit and biscuits to keep your energy and attention nice and high at all times! For your meals we have a couple of fridges
on site that are for you to use and also there is a lovely eatery just next door. If you need to pop to the shops, then there is a supermarket within
5 - 6 minutes walk.

#Access

We provide you with a key/code so if you arrive early or want to stay in the training space late then you have the freedom to do this.
