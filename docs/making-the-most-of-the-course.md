#Effort will be rewarded

You will really find that you get back exactly what you put in so embrace all the extras you are asked to do.

- Extra challenges, e.g. Codewars
- Really prepare for your meetings with the mentors, ask them questions, get their input into your technical task, CV, portfolio and be prepared to act on any feedback given.
- Go to meetups. These are amazing as often event just one person you meet can start the ball rolling on many things and opportunity, so really you can control your career destiny too by getting out and networking.
