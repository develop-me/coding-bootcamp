#Friday 1:1 Sessions

It is important to feel you can feedback or voice any concerns as you move through the Bootcamp and we will always give you pointers on how to 
make the most of your time with us.

So each Friday you will have a session with Oli or Pete to:

- Check how you are getting from your prospective
- Get feedback on any improvements to course
- Give you feedback on how you're doing, areas you need to improve and spend more time on
- Identify any gaps youâ€™d like a session on

You'll need to ensure your JS programming skills are up-to-scratch to undertake React
